  type. <a href="https://play.golang.org/p/FftVX-zHkA" class="playground" target="_blank">Try it here</a>.

  A useful guide to decide whether to declare a method receiver as a pointer type or not
  is in the FAQ: <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#methods_on_values_or_pointers">Should I define methods on values or pointers?</a>.
