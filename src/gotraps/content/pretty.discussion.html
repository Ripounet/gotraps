	You may add an int variable and a (untyped) character constant, and the result is an int. This is counterintuitive because Go variables are
	strongly typed and cannot be loosely mixed.	However, constants are more liberal : this is explained thoroughly <a href="http://blog.golang.org/constants">in this blog post</a>.

	Fortunatly, the compiler usually yells. It's won't let you use the wrong type as a function parameter or as a function result.
