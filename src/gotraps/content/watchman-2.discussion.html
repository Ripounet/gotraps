	It's nice to see that the filtering has detected the impostor. But <code>Here is my greeting</code> was
	definitely not supposed to be printed.

<p>
	The problem is that <code>msg, err := greet(name)</code> does declare a new variable <code>msg</code>, and also 
	accidentally shadows the result parameter <code>err</code>. This is tricky because using the short declaration
	operator <code>:=</code> allows mixing new and existing variables, and it works well on 
	<a href="http://play.golang.org/p/Fhv5R1AK-M" class="playground" target="_blank">a very similar code</a>. It depends whether the scope
	of the existing variable is exactly the same as the scope of the assignment, or not.
