Strings are essentially slices of bytes, and are not required to be UTF-8 encoded. But the <b>range</b> loop assumes UTF-8 
encoding. The iteration element is the <b>rune</b> (like a character), and the index is the byte number of the first byte of the rune (not the number of 
the rune). Thus, when the multi-byte character <b>Ã©</b> is encountered, the index 4 is skipped.<br>
