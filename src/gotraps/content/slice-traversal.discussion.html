	<b><a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#for">range</a></b> (over a slice) with only one variable yields the index, not
	the element. To iterate over the elements and ignore the indexes, use the 
	<a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#blank">blank identifier</a> :
	<code>for _, nephew := range nephews</code>. <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/w6F_L6j0ra" class="playground" target="_blank">Try it</a>.

<p>
	The result may surprise a beginner the first time, but Go programmers enjoy the <code>range</code> construct
	because it gives both the key and the element as iteration variables.
</p>
<p>
	When the type of your slice elements is not <code>int</code>, confusion is unlikely because the compiler won't
	let you use the index instead of the element: iteration variables are strongly typed and the types would mismatch.
	But if you're iterating over a <code>[]int</code>, you have to carefully name and use the index and the element: the
	compiler won't shout.
