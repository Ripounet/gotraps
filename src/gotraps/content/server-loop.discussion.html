  Using <b>break</b> here does not exit the <b>for</b> loop, it exits the <b>select</b> block. This is counterintuitive 
  because there is no possible fallthrough between cases in a <b>select</b>.

  You may however add a <b>label</b> on the for loop, and use this label with break. <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/0JWtSGYnxW" class="playground" target="_blank">Try it</a>.
